                                <p>{"Casinos online have not always been around, but we can safely say that online casinos have been used a lot since they came on the market. And it's not in short demand nor options, and now in 2023, we have 1000s and 1000s to pick from – it's just a matter of what you like and what payment options you would like to see at the casino."}</p>
                                <p>{"Players are always looking for something new, which will help make the gaming experience so much better and more accessible. Allowing the player to focus on the absolute fun of a casino, that's right, the games themselves."}</p>

                                    <p>{"Before discussing what casino games you can play, you first need to understand what crypto is and why people prefer to use this payment option when you play your favorite games."}</p>
                                    <p>{"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been growing and making a big name for themselves over the last few years. When it just started, it was a risk to buy bitcoin and the ones taking the risk are the ones benefiting from it now. Crypto has been probable fair income from it going up and down in the market, and the best about it all – is that you can do it completely anonymously."}</p>
                                    <p>{"It might have been a risk back then, but today you can use bitcoin like any other payment option. A few are not accepting it, but BTC casino is a big hit and has continued to grow over the last 5+ years."}</p>
                                    <p>{"And what most like about bitcoin as a deposit bonus or as a payment option, in general, is that you can easily link your bitcoin account to your bank account and have direct and instant access to your top crypto fun."}</p>

                                    <h2>Can you use bitcoin on all online gambling sites?</h2>
                                    <p>{"All players would dream that all the different online casinos you find will allow you to use bitcoin and other crypto for your deposit and withdrawals. Unfortunately, the sad truth is that very few casinos accept it. But the good news is that the top online casinos will have one or the other crypto that you can at least use for deposits. When it comes to withdrawals, it's a bit harder to find a casino. Most likely, you'll have to pick one of the other payment options. The most found payment option to combine with bitcoin and crypto is a bank transfer straight into your bank account."}</p>
                                    <p>{"For the newbies out there, we will drop a few names for other casinos to look at if you would like to try out betting sites that accept crypto. We have Doge Casino, Shiba Casino, and Solana Casino, and they are all worth your time. They will bring the excitement you are all seeking. You can pay with bitcoin – and the best part is that they are all giving you a great deposit bonus for using their casino and joining the crypto gambling world."}</p>

                                        <li>{"Anonymity – when using crypto on the online market, you do not need to give information that can lead back to you. You can hide 100% behind the computer screen and never give up as much as your first name. This is the top-selling point for this type of payment option for many."} </li>
                                        <li>{"Worldwide access – as we know, many payment options are only available for some, not all, and it can be very frustrating and can be challenging for some players in some countries – because their limitations on payment options are severely blocking them from playing on the casinos and games they want to play on. With Bitcoin casinos and other crypto casinos, they will remove this limit and no longer have to look elsewhere for their fun."} </li>
                                        <li>{"Verification – a real party pooper is when you have to fill out much information to access the fun. The simple answer is to use crypto, and you will no longer need to experience this."} </li>
                                        <li>{"Transaction fees – ok, we understand that everyone needs to make money and that it's not all that gets covered by the ads, etc., that runs in the background and the standard fees that come with a transaction. But we also know that some payment options like to lay heavy on the fees they charge their clients when they use their service. If you use crypto as a payment option, you will not find this problem."} </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2>Disadvantages of crypto gambling</h2>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>{"No chargebacks/reversals – unfortunately, you have no take backs when using this payment option. Once the transaction has been confirmed on your account and left your wallet, that's it. So be sure that you do your background check on the casino or online gambling site you want to spend your time and money on as you do not have the same security as credit cards and other traditional payment methods."} </li>
                                        <li>{"No 'the customer is always right' – when comes to the problems with transactions, their customer service have been described not to be the best. They run good communication with all their customers, and you will not be left to sort it by yourself or anything. But the chances of getting money back once it has left your account are slim to none. So you need to be sure when you use it and how much you wish to use and that you really can trust the person/company you are making the payment to."}</li>

                                    <h2>How can I be sure the online casino site is safe?</h2>
                                    <p>{"Most casinos online today are safe, and you don't need to worry about spending your time at them. However, there are some casinos that do not have your best interest at heart. That's why you always need to do your background check even when it comes to crypto gambling, or should we say at least if you want to use bitcoin to gamble. There's no extra security, and when the money leaves your wallet, you do not have a lot of chances to get the money back."} </p>
                                    <p>{"Luckily there are ways to find out if you can truly trust the casino you want to spend your time on. The best way is to check if the casino has a valid license for online gambling. All casinos need this to run their casino legally, and it is not free, so it wouldn't be something they hide. Some casinos choose to obtain more than one of these licenses. This is a red flag for some, and we are here to tell you that it is not a red flag. A casino can have as many licenses as they please, but they can also have one."} </p>
                                    <p>{"Also, searching the casino to look at what other players are saying is always a good idea. If a casino were to be unfair, you would not be the first one they have done it to – so there will be some kind of reviews out there telling you about what happened and what has been done about it. Use your best judgment, and if something feels off about the gambling site, then there's a lot more out there. Pick a different one, and there's no need to gamble with faith."} </p>

                                    <h2>Do you still get bonuses if you deposit with crypto?</h2>
                                    <p>{"We can say that it's the casino experience, the thrill, the fun, and the games that bring the players to the different casinos, but we all know it would be a lie. Players want bonuses and a lot of bonuses to help them on their way to winning big. Bonuses are just like free money, and just watch the conditions that come with the bonuses before you accept them."} </p>
                                    <p>{"Suppose you are to be deposited with crypto. In that case, user experience tells us that the bonuses are minor but not bad for what you get. If you are a first-time player at the casino, you will find a welcome package on a bitcoin casino. This is the bonus that will start your journey on the casino, and it will help you go for the big jackpot."} </p>
                                    <p>{"It's not just the welcome bonus that's available. After using the welcome bonus, you need to keep your eyes out for the deposit bonus. That's the bonus the casinos sometimes give on a random deposit you set during your play. And if you are fortunate, it will bring big or small jackpots with it as you go."} </p>
                                    <p>{"Just as when you set a standard deposit, you claim your bonus in the cashier when you put a crypto deposit. And remember that no one can force you into taking that bonus. The choice is yours. It's a choice you should make after you have looked over all the terms and conditions that come with the bonus. Remember, the wager requirements must be fulfilled before you can withdraw any of the winnings you are lucky enough to win. Also, remember that even though there's a chance of winning a lot of money, you have to remember casinos are only for entertainment."} </p>

                                        <li>{"Make sure you can play – most casinos have a list of restricted countries that cannot play in their casino. Make sure that your country isn't on the restricted list."}</li>

                                    <h2>What games can you find in a crypto casino?</h2>
                                    <p>What makes the best user experience for an online gambling site is what games you can
                                        find at the casino. A player needs to be able to find a few to choose from, and it needs
                                        to be some kind of balance to keep the market open for more than one type of player.</p>
                                    <p>Online slots are the absolute favorite among the players on the market, and let us just
                                        tell you a bit of what you can expect from an online slot machine on a crypto gambling
                                        site.</p>
                                    <p>{"Any game on a slot machine will be completely random, just like tossing coins. The computer program that controls the game selects a random symbol on the first row, then the second. Payback is the percentage of money paid back to the player on average. Each spin on the game has the same chance of winning or losing as the previous game; it has nothing to say how long since the last jackpot was paid out or whether the slot machine is 'hot' or 'cold.'"} </p>
                                    <p>{"In the 80s, slot machines became very popular and even surpassed table games such as craps and blackjack. Slot machines and video poker now make up more than 70 percent of the casinos' profits. Now that we have gone online, it continues to profit from online crypto and bitcoin casinos and the casinos that don't accept the crypto methods. This is for a simple reason: big jackpots. When slot machines were digitized, it became possible to make the jackpot win less frequent, which also meant that the jackpot on online slot machines became larger when you first won it. And players love big jackpots! If you play for 5 dollars on a blackjack table, you can win a maximum of 7.5 dollars, but if you play with 3 dollars on a slot machine, you can win several thousand or millions of dollars in one go, but this is only if you are lucky. As we said before, you have to always look at casino games as entertainment and not a quick payday."} </p>
                                    <p>But despite their popularity, there are three major problems with playing slot machines
                                        versus table games. First of all, casinos are not always open about the odds they place
                                        on each game, and this means that it is difficult to know how likely it is to win.
                                        Second, no matter what these secret odds are, they are often wrong and worse than table
                                        games such as craps, baccarat, and blackjack. Thirdly, slot machines run much faster
                                        than other games, and thus you can lose a lot of money in a short amount of time.</p>
                                    <p>{"Table games are the next big thing on online casinos, so let's talk about what you can expect from this type of game and give you newbies out there a chance to quickly learn before they buy bitcoin to spend their hard-earned money on online slots and other games for a quick payout."} </p>
                                    <p>Most casinos offer table games, and if you play at a casino that does not have them, you
                                        should consider finding another casino that offers this.</p>
                                    <p>You do not have to play for money to play table games. Many casinos offer free play or
                                        demo play, so you do not deposit real money. In the long run, this may get a little
                                        boring, but there are full opportunities to deposit cash at a later date.</p>
                                    <p>How much you bet on a table game is up to you, but it is often a minimum bet to
                                        participate. This varies with the different casino sites, so feel free to check out
                                        yourself when you have found a casino that you will play at.</p>
                                    <p>Online Blackjack, also called twenty-one, is a table game most people associate with the
                                        casino. Nowadays, you can play blackjack at home in the living room, as long as you
                                        connect online and make a deposit at a casino. All the primary providers of casinos have
                                        blackjack in their portfolio.</p>
                                    <p>Online Poker is an exciting card game that suits most people. It takes time to become
                                        good at poker, and there has been a lot of discussion about whether poker is a game of
                                        skill. Here, there are conflicting opinions from the poker industry and authorities. The
                                        poker industry, for its part, believes that it is a game of skill. At the same time, the
                                        authorities see poker as a game under the Lottery Act and are more about luck than
                                        skill.</p>
                                    <p>Video Poker was early to be digital, so it was one of the first games you could play
                                        without having to hold cards in your hand. Video poker is almost always based on regular
                                        poker, where you play with the top five cards in your hand.</p>
                                    <p>Jacks, or better, is a common form of video poker. Here you win money as soon as you have

                                    <p>In roulette, you can bet on combinations, single numbers, colors, rows, and whether the
                                        ball lands on odd or even numbers. The payout amount varies according to what you bet
                                        on. For even numbers and odd numbers, the payout sum is 1 to 1, which applies to red or
                                        black.</p>
                                    <p>There is also a different range you can bet on here. The payout varies depending on which

                                    <p>Craps is a dice game where a player bets on the outcome of two dice. It sounds pretty
                                        simple but probably needs some explanation to understand how to play the game. The
                                        advantage of craps is that only dice are required to play, so you can easily play craps
                                        as long as you have two dice.</p>
                                    <p>{"If you have been to a casino, you know how it feels. Live casino gives you a bit of the same feeling. In some of the casinos, you have the opportunity to chat with the host along the way. It provides excitement, joy, and maybe a little frustration to play live casino, depending on the game's result."} </p>
                                    <p>If you want to play live casino, you must register with one of the gaming providers that
                                        offer this. It is easy to register with a foreign gaming company, and you only fill in
                                        with information about yourself. After this, you deposit bitcoin or another form of real
                                        money and start playing.</p>
                                    <p>Casino players expect the casino to offer live casinos. It is so common to play live
                                        casinos that all casinos should have this in their range.</p>
                                    <p>There are several types of live casino games you can play online, and roulette and
                                        blackjack are the most common forms of live casinos. But there are also games like
                                        Monopoly, and you will become a millionaire and spin wheels you can play live.</p>
                                    <p>The selection of games is usually massive, but you need to know that it varies from
                                        casino to casino, so you will not always wind the same crypto casino games on different
                                        crypto casino sites. This is why we told you when giving you tips for what casinos to
                                        play, or not what casinos to play, but how to find the perfect casino for you to look at
                                        the games you can find on the casino.</p>
                                    <p>{"And remember to check out what kind of bonuses you can get. Not all casinos give you a deposit bonus, but they will provide you with the reload bonuses. So, you can find reload bonuses and no deposit bonus if you don't check good enough before you start. And if you are lucky, you can find casinos that give away daily cashback."} </p>

                                    <p>{"Betting sites that offer mobile casinos are getting more hits in a day than the ones not offering mobile casinos.
