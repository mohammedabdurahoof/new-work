                                <p>All withdrawals will be subject to an internal audit before being processed. BC.GAME reserves all
                                    rights to void Bonuses or any winnings for failed audits. The Player hereby consents in advance
                                    to the same. If, upon such a review, it appears that a Player(s) are participating in actions,
                                    taking advantage of any software or system bug or failure, BC.GAME reserves the right to revoke
                                    the entitlement of such a Player to receive or benefit from the promotion (and/or withhold the
                                    payout of the proceeds of such abuse to the Player/s in question). Only fully settled bets (i.e.
                                    bets that result in a win or loss) will be counted towards wagering.</p>
                                <p>The use of bonus funds purely to progress through the bonus stages is prohibited. For example
                                    when a bonus or cash funds are used purely to progress through the bonus stages (e.g. collecting
                                    9 out of 10 coins to reach that bonus feature) and then final stages (e.g. playing to collect
                                    the final coin to reach 10 out of 10 coins to reach the bonus feature) completed with cash bets
                                    when bonus funds have been forfeited, lost or wagering met and converted to cash. All the
                                    winnings gained during that play may be considered void.</p>
                                <p>Multiple accounts are not permitted. Creating more than one accounts with BC.GAME in order to
                                    claim any bonuses is deemed as bonus abuse and may result in confiscated funds.</p>
                                <p>The English version of these Bonus Terms is general and final. Translations into other languages
                                    may be made as a service and are made in good faith. However, in the event of differences
                                    between the English version and a translation, the English version has priority over any
                                    translation.</p>
                                <p>BC.GAME management has the right to update these rules at any time.</p>
