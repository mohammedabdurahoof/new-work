                                <p>
                                    Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that does not rely on any real
                                    substance and makes use of cryptography, eg. Bitcoin, Litecoin, BitShares, etc.
                                    It is a digital currency that is created, distributed, and maintained
                                    based on cryptography and validation technology. The characteristics of
                                    cryptocurrency are its application of P2P technology and the fact that
                                    everyone issues it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Cryptocurrency is also an online payment system that supports anonymous transactions.
                                    Bitcoin is the top cryptocurrency, and is recognised by the laws in many countries.

                                <p>
                                    Due to several reasons, crytocurrency is the most popular and widely used
                                    digital currency. In contrast to traditional transfer,Cryptocurrency transfers
                                    never require several hours of waiting, and are not affected by the transfer
                                    amount or the region of the user. The fee is also much lower, and is usually
                                    a few cents. Refund will not happen to cryptocurrency, and no cheating is
                                    possible. No bank, government agency, or individual could manipulate
                                    cryptocurrency. In contrast to traditional currency, cryptocurrency
                                    transactions are anonymous, and there is no threat of confiscation.

                                <h2>How does cryptocurrency transaction work?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Cryptocurrency transactions are actually very simple. Basically it is to
                                    send cryptocurrency from an online wallet to another. The first step in the
                                    whole process is that the payer sends a private key (a randomly generated
                                    sequence of numbers) to the payee, after which a transaction will go through
                                    0 to 5 validations. An ordinary transaction will go through 1 validation,
                                    but if the amount is very large, it is better to perform multiple
                                    validations. It takes about 10 minutes for a single validation on the
                                    blockchain network. After validation, anyone on the blockchain can check
                                    this transaction but could not see any sensitive information.
                                </p>

                                <p>Cryptocurrency can be purchased at the following places:</p>
                                <p>
                                    Market exchange: If the buyer does not care much about privacy, then an
                                    online market exchange is the best option to buy cryptocurrency because
                                    market exchanges usually require the buyers to provide identification.
                                    Buyers could purchase cryptocurrency from a market exchange and store it
                                    there.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Over the counter: This means two people perform a cryptocurrency transaction
                                    face-to-face. Usually cryptocurrency transactions are carried out
                                    anonymously between the two parties. Although the face-to-face approach does
                                    not enjoy this benefit, it is still very popular. Sellers and buyers could
                                    contact each other through many websites.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Cryptocurrency ATM: These ATM are no different from normal ATM apart from
                                    that the buyer gets a receipt with a certain code instead of cash. By
                                    scanning the code, the bitcoin will be transferred to the buyer’s wallet.

                                <p>
                                    Simply put, the legal status of cryptocurrency is getting better. In the
                                    past few months, Japan announced to recognise bitcoin as a legal currency,
                                    and Russia also declared its plan to recognise bitcoin as a financial tool.
                                    This is a major change of stance for Russia, since bitcoin was originally
                                    banned in Russia.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While cryptocurrency gradually becomes a strong and important global
                                    currency, this kind of change will also increase. The regulation on, use of,
                                    and taxation on cryptocurrency still vary across countries. On the other
                                    hand, new laws and rules are published all the time. If you wish to know in
                                    details about your government’s stance on cryptocurrency and potential
                                    changes in the future, please contact a legal consultant.

                                    that stores cryptocurrency. There is a common function among the various

                                    However, storing cryptocurrency in the cloud means handing over the

                                    Therefore, mutual trust between the two parties is vital in storing

                                    A software wallet is a downloadable program that can be run on computers,
                                    tablet computers, or mobile phones. A software wallet is safer than a
                                    cloud-based one because you can take full control of it. However, a software
                                    wallet still has its risks.

                                    A hardware wallet stores the user’s private key in a secure hardware device.
                                    Compared to software wallets, one of the main advantages of hardware wallets
                                    is immunity against computer virus. Moreover, since the private key is
                                    stored in the protected zone of a microcontroller, it cannot be transferred
                                    out of the device in cleartext.

                                <p>
                                    When used properly, bitcoin is highly secure. Please always remember it is
                                    your responsibility to take measures to protect your money.
                                </p>
                                <p>You should consider the following points:</p>
                                <p>Like legal tender, do not put all your money in one wallet.</p>
                                <p>Choose your online wallet carefully. 2FA is a good extra guarantee.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Back up your wallet regularly. It is also a good practice to encrypt backups
                                    that are exposed to the Internet.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Store the password in a secure location. You may memorise your password, or
                                    store it in a secure physical location.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Choose a strong password that contains letters, numbers, and symbols, and is
                                    at least 16 characters long.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Offline wallet, also known as cold storage, provides the highest security
                                    for your deposit. It is to hide the wallet in a secure place that is not
                                    connected to the Internet. If implemented well, this option could provide
                                    excellent protection against computer vulnerabilities.
