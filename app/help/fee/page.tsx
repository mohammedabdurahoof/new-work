                                    When we make a transaction, the information is broadcast to the network, and
                                    the miners collect and package the production blocks, and only after the
                                    block is produced, the transaction is recognized. Although the miners will
                                    get a fixed monetary reward after digging into the block, according to the
                                    rules, the reward will gradually be halved and become less and less, and
                                    eventually the miners may not be profitable. Therefore, transaction fees are
                                    needed to maintain the enthusiasm of miners for mining.
                                </p>

                                <h2>The role of the Withdraw fee</h2>
                                <p>1. Encourage miners to mine</p>
                                <p>
                                    2. Prevent excessive small transactions from hitting the network. Due to the
                                    P2P network, the ability of transaction processing is limited. If everyone
                                    frequently conducts small transactions, the network will be congested,
                                    causing delays or even stagnation. So set a threshold, the amount of natural
                                    transactions will be reduced when there is a small transaction.

                                <p>
                                    Since the transaction is a two-way charge, it means that the sale of a
                                    digital currency requires at least a 0.1% Withdraw fee to the platform.
