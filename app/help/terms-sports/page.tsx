                                    delivery.<br />For settlement purposes, all illegal balls count as deliveries. For example, if
                                    an over starts with a
                                    wide, then the first delivery will be settled as 1 and, although there has not been a legal
                                    ball bowled, the next
                                    ball will be deemed as delivery 2 for that over.<br />If a delivery leads to free hit or a
                                    free hit is to be
                                    re-bowled because of an illegal delivery, the runs scored off the additional delivery do not

                                    whether off the bat or not are included. For example, a wide with three extra runs taken
                                    equates to 4 runs in
                                    total off that delivery.</span></p>

                                <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                                <p id="h.wd6w7qqxg5c2"><span className="c7">1. General rules applicable to esports</span></p>
                                <p><span>1.1. All esports markets are based on in-game score events or results at the end of a
                                    scheduled match/map. All settlements will occur using the official score and results, which
                                    are declared on the
                                    official video stream or the in-game stream of the relevant matches.</span></p>
                                <p><span>1.2. All match start dates and times displayed for Esports matches are for indication
                                    purposes only and are not guaranteed to be correct. Bets will stand if a match is offered
                                    with an incorrect date
                                    and/or time.</span></p>
                                <p><span>1.3. If a match is paused/postponed and not rescheduled to a later time within 24 hours
                                    of the actual scheduled start time, then all bets on that match will be voided.</span></p>
                                <p><span>1.4. If the name of a player/team/tournament is misspelled, all bets will still stand
                                    unless it’s obvious that the misspelled name is the same as a different
                                    entity/person.</span></p>
                                <p><span>1.5. If a team name is changed due to a team leaving the organization, joining another
                                    organization, or due to an official change of team name, all bets will stand.<br />1.6. If the
                                    organizer of the
                                    event allows for stand-ins and there is an official result, all bets will be resulted as
                                    normal.
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                                <p><span>1.7. In the case where there is an overruling of a match result by the organizer due to
                                    unforeseen circumstances - such as cheating - all bets on that match will be voided. This
                                    rule is applicable
                                    within 72 hours from the end of the match, after the term sportsbook will not change the
                                    result of the
                                    tickets.</span></p>
                                <p><span>1.8. If a match has been declared as a walkover win by the tournament organizer, all
                                    bets will be void.</span></p>
                                <p><span>1.9. If one team retires during a match, only wagers on the completed individual maps
                                    will be resulted. Match market, match side markets, and all other undecided map markets will
                                    be voided. Bets
                                    placed on any following maps that will be completed will be resulted with the official
                                    results. However, any and
                                    all live offer will be suspended on this match and moved to a new match with a different
                                    match ID that will
                                    genuinely reflect the state of the match. The only exemption to this rule would be in this
                                    very situation: team A
                                    wins map 1 and proceeds to forfeit map 2. In this case, we would void all wagers on all
                                    undecided match and map 2
                                    markets and continue our offer within map 3 of the match.

                                </p>

                                    goals or more margin). In the eventuality that Team A wins with only a 2 goal margin, the
                                    bet will be considered
                                    as partially won with a full payout on the -1.5 part of the bet and a refund on the -2.0
                                    side since the outcome on
                                    that part of the bet would be considered a “tie”. Should the match produce any other
                                    outcome,
                                    including a Team A victory with only 1 goal margin, the whole stake would be lost. Away

                                    goal advantage in the match. This means that the stake is divided into 2 equal bets and
                                    placed on the outcomes
                                    +1.5 and +2.0.</span></p>

                                    added to the team total, off the specified delivery. For example, if an over starts with a
                                    wide, then the first
                                    delivery will be settled as 1 and, although there has not been a legal ball bowled, the next
