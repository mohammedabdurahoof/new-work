                                    We may make changes to our Privacy Policy in the future; however, the most current version of the
                                    policy will govern our processing of your personal data and will always be available to you. If we make
                                    a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you by an update or
                                    email, where possible. By continuing to access or use our services, you agree to be bound to the terms
                                    of our Privacy Policy.

                                    We will confirm your email within three (3) days and strive to resolve your problem within one (1) month
                                    after receipt or within an appropriate period not exceeding the legal requirements. If the relevant issue
                                    is more complex or a large number of issues are received, we will notify you that it will take more than
                                    1 month to resolve the issue, and we will try to resolve your issue within 2 months after we first
                                    receive the issue. We may accept your question in accordance with the law. We may reject requests that
                                    are unreasonable or outside legal requirements, including requests that are highly impractical, require a
                                    disproportionate amount of technical effort, or may expose us to operational risks such as condoning
                                    fraud.
