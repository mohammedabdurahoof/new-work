                                <h2>Definitions ML</h2>
                                <p>Money Laundering: The process of making illegally gained proceeds appear legal. This process is
                                    generally broken down into three steps: placement, layering, and integration. Placement: The
                                    process of placing unlawful proceeds into traditional financial institutions, through deposits
                                    or other avenues. Layering: The process of separating proceeds of criminal activity from their
                                    origin by layers of complex financial transactions, such as converting cash into traveler’s
                                    checks, money orders, wire transfers, letters of credit, stocks, bonds, or purchasing assets.
                                    Integration: Using legitimate transactions to disguise the illicit proceeds, allowing the
                                    laundered funds to be distributed back to the criminal; integrating the now clean money back
                                    into normal use.</p>

                                <p>In order to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, we require a 1x mandatory wager
                                    on all deposits before initiating a withdrawal request. Failure to meet this requirement may
                                    result in restrictions or denial of withdrawal until it is fulfilled. Once the one-time turnover
                                    requirement is met, users can request withdrawals based on the profit earned from their deposit.
                                    For instance, if User A deposits $100, they must engage in $100 worth of wagers to initiate a
                                    withdrawal. If User A subsequently generates a profit of $58 from this 1x wagering activity, the
                                    accurate withdrawal amount for User A is $158. Users can participate in additional wagering
                                    activities to accumulate further rewards.</p>
