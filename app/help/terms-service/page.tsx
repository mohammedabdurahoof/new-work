                                <p>11. Governing Law</p>
                                <p>The Agreement and any matters relating thereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
                                    with, the laws of Curacao. You irrevocably agree that, subject as provided below, the courts of

                                    Nothing in this clause shall limit the right of BC.GAME to take proceedings against you in any
                                    other court of competent jurisdiction, nor shall the taking of proceedings in any one or more

                                    concurrently or not, to the extent permitted by the law of such other jurisdiction.</p>
                                <p>If a provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any
                                    jurisdiction, that shall not affect the validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any

                                <p>14. ADVANTAGE PLAY</p>
                                <p>Should the Casino become aware of any user who has accepted the bonus or a promotion with sole
                                    purpose of creating a positive expected value on bonus return by using known practices aimed at
                                    securing a cash out of said bonus or at any way try to take advantage of bonuses received by
                                    BC.GAME, then BC.GAME will enforce immediate confiscation of winnings and closure of the account
                                    with the right to withhold any further withdrawals. An example of advantage play would be
                                    delaying any game round in any game, including free spins features and bonus features, to a
                                    later time when you have no more wagering requirement and/or performing new deposit(s) while
                                    having free spins features or bonus features still available in a game. In the interests of fair
                                    gaming, equal, zero or low margin bets or hedge betting, shall all be considered irregular
                                    gaming for bonus play- through requirement purposes. Should the Casino deem that irregular game
                                    play has occurred, the Casino reserves the right to withhold any withdrawals and/or confiscate
                                    all winnings.</p>
